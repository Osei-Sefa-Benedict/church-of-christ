										<p>I still remember the first time I ever sang the hymn “To God Be The Glory”.  The Kleinwood church in Houston had purchased new Songs of the Church books to replace our worn-out Sacred Selections.  David Pickup was assigned to teach the congregation some of the newer songs and chose “To God Be the Glory” as one of his selections.
										</p>
										<p>When we came to the chorus, the phrase that jumped off the page to me was the line:  “Praise the Lord, let the earth hear His voice.”  We are used to making requests in our songs and prayers that the Lord listen to our praises and hear our petitions.  But this song calls on the earth and all it contains to give attention to the divine voice of their Creator.
										</p>
										<p>We certainly hear His voice with regard to salvation.  In fact, “To God Be The Glory” was originally entitled “Praise For Redemption”.  When we read the inspired word, we are in awe of the “great things He has done” to provide for our pardon from sin.  We can hear with great clarity His voice from heaven, “This is My beloved Son.  Hear Him!” (Mark 9:7)
										</p>
										<p>But that’s not the only way God communicates His existence and expressions of love (Ps. 19:1; rom. 1:20).  Fanny J. Crosby, the blind hymnist, wrote this beautiful song during one of her famous “night watches”.  Her experience testifies to the fact that the earth can hear the Lord’s voice in the beauty of His creation.
										</p>
										<p>We hear His voice of power.  Flooding along the Mississippi River.  Tornadoes in Alabama and Missouri.  Wildfires in Texas.  These recent natural disasters remind us just how helpless we are to control the forces of nature.  We have made remarkable advancements in the fields of communication, science, and technology, but we will ever be at the mercy of Him who spoke it all into being.  “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Gen. 1:1).  And thousands of years later, this is still our Father’s world.
										</p>
										<p>What this power demands is submission.  In recognition of God’s power and might, we glorify Him when we revere His name and obey His will.  The winds and the waves do.  How much more ought we who are anchored in hope and washed in the blood?  Let the earth hear His voice and bow before Him.
										</p>
										<p>We hear His voice of provision.  God not only created the heavens and the earth, He sustains their existence.  I am reminded of this ever morning when I take my coffee out on the front porch and watch the world wake up.  We have a bird feeder, but it’s more for our enjoyment than the birds’ nourishment.  The Lord carefully looks after them and over all His creatures, great and small.  Jesus said, “Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father’s will.” (Matt. 10:29).
										</p>
										<p>What this provision calls for is thanksgiving.  Not only do we tend to blame God for things He does not do, we take credit for the great things He has done.  When God provides, let Him hear our voices of thanksgiving.  When we began to worry about food or drink or clothing, let us be reassured by His voice of provision in creation.  He cares for the lilies of the field and the birds of the air.  “Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.” (Matt. 10:31).  Let the earth hear His voice and trust Him.
										</p>
										<p>We hear His voice of purpose.  Sometimes, when looking at a breath-taking sunset or majestic mountainside, someone will say, “I don’t know how anyone could look at that and not believe in God.”  That’s the point.  We’re not supposed to.  But what’s even more amazing is that the One who ordered and arranged the universe did so with you and me in mind.  David marveled at the same truth.  “When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You have ordained, what is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of man that You visit him” (Ps. 8:3-4)?  God not only considered man, He crowned him.
										</p>
										<p>What this purpose requires is fulfillment.  Is there anything that has been created that does not have some function or use?  When wolves were killed off in the Rocky Mountain National Park, the elk population reached dangerous levels and was deemed out of control.  The solution?  Reintroduce wolves back into the ecosystem.  Let us not lose sight of our even greater purpose in the world.  When we allow sin to cause us to “fall short of the glory of God” (Rom. 3:23), we are not fulfilling what we were put here to do.  Let the earth hear His voice and serve Him. 
										</p>
										<p>“Praise the Lord, let the earth hear His voice!  And give Him the glory, great things He hath done!”  This we must do while we await the new heavens and the new earth. 
										</p>

										<h3 class="event-title"><b> Answering Criticism</b></h3>

										<p>
											The Lord tells us that when we have a problem with a brother, we are to talk with them about it (Matt. 18:15-17). We understand the wisdom behind this instruction. It is best for the sake of peace and unity to get things worked out as quickly as possible. And sitting down and talking with someone is the best way to do this. This instruction is easy to understand, but sometimes hard to obey. In this article, we want to discuss how we should respond when we are the person that a brother is coming to. What do we do when the criticism and accusations are directed toward us? Consider the following points.
											 </p>
										<p>Watch out for pride. The Scriptures never use the word pride in a good sense. John tells us that pride is one of the avenues through which Satan tempts us (1 John 2:16). It is hard not to take a confrontation from a brother as a personal attack. Our pride is at stake, and our immediate reaction is to defend it. But if we do, we are opening the door for sin. “My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing” (James 1:2-4). Yes, our faith is going to be tested. And the fact is that sometimes our own brethren will be the ones who put us to the test. We would do well to exhibit patience when we are being confronted and challenged. According to James, patience under these circumstances is a sign of a perfect and complete Christian.
										</p>
										<p>
											Are you sure you have to go on the defensive? Just ask yourself, “What is their demeanor? Are they sincere?” If they are, consider how hard this must be for them, listen to them patiently, and be thoughtful in your reply. Remember, “A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger” (Prov. 15:1). Don't make a hard situation worse by thinking you have to defend your pride.
											 </p>
										<p>Never misuse the Scriptures. We are Christians. We believe the Bible is our guide in all matters. So when we are being challenged, we naturally want to get our Bible and defend ourselves. We need to be careful about this approach to the Bible. When we open our Bible and say, “Where is that verse? It must be in here somewhere,” we have gone to the Bible to find a verse that will justify ourselves, not to learn the truth! The Bible should not be used this way. The Scriptures were meant to equip us for every good work, not excuse us from questionable ones (2 Tim. 3:16-17). If our frame of mind is not set on a search for the truth, we had best leave our Bible alone. The Word of God must be our guide, not an afterthought.
										</p>
										<p>It is not important that you be right, but that you be right with God. You shouldn't fall into the trap of trying to win the argument. If the brother challenging you is sincere and their concern is for your soul, you shouldn't be interested in shooting down their charges. If they are misunderstanding you and a discussion causes them to change their mind, you haven't won an argument, you have “gained your brother” (Matt. 18:15).
										</p>
										<p>
											This goes back to pride. Pride tells us that it is important to be right. If we aren’t careful it will cause us to try to justify ourselves and defeat their argument. We may even throw an attack back at them. We must think differently. What matters is that we are right with God. We need to be more like Paul whose desire was to live in all good conscience before God and men (Acts 23:1). When he found out that he was wrong about Jesus Christ, he changed. David exhibited this attitude as well. When Nathan convicted him of his sin, he didn't try to defend himself. He simply confessed that he had sinned against God.
											 </p>
										<p>Honest and sincere people have been wrong before. Why would it be any different for you or me? Show a willingness to consider their point of view. Admit that you could be wrong. This is not a sign of weakness; it’s an attitude that makes you easier to approach. Having a humble attitude goes a long way in helping situations like this. They are not going to be willing to reason with you if they can see that you are unwilling to reason with them.
										</p>
										<p>
											We need to consider our brethren. Paul taught us that even when we are right, we must be willing to forgo our liberties to keep from offending a brother (Rom. 14:13-21; 1 Cor. 8:9-13). Let's say that Paul had done something that had offended a weak or conscientious brother. His immediate concern would not be to justify his action, but to mend the brother he had “offended,” “wounded” or “grieved.” Just because we have the right to do something doesn't always mean that it is the right thing to do, especially if it is having an adverse effect on another Christian. “Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself. Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others” (Phil. 2:3-4).
											 </p>
										<p>Talking to brethren when things aren't going right isn't always easy. The temptation is to just ignore the instructions found in Matthew 18:15-17. Unfortunately, many brethren have taken the easy out and now are at odds with their brethren. The Lord has told us to go, but He has also told us what to do when one comes to us. Resolving disagreements depends on how criticism is received as much as on how it is delivered. “Therefore let us pursue the things which make for peace and the things by which one may edify another” (Rom. 14:19).

										<h3 class="event-title"><b> Our Declaration Of Independence</b></h3>

										<p>ndependence.  It’s a word that invokes much emotion, especially to those in this country who enjoy many freedoms due to the Continental Congress’ vote on July 2, 1776 to declare independence from Great Britain.  It’s a word that invokes many images in our minds.  Fireworks.  Hamburgers and hot dogs.  Apple pie.  Patriotic music.  Red, white, and blue.
										</p>
										<p>Indeed, we live in a richly blessed country.  Even with all of its problems, it’s the best country in the world.  We are free to live where we want.  We can work anywhere we’d like.  We are allowed to make as much money as we can.  We have the freedom to travel between the states and out of the country at our leisure.  We can write and speak just about anything that’s on our mind.  We have the right to protest peacefully and speak negatively about our government and its leaders without fear of the government attacking us.  We can worship our God according to our beliefs, rather than in a manner that the government dictates.  Simply put, we have all manners of freedoms.
										</p>
										<p>In recent months, countries in the Middle East and North Africa, such as Syria, Egypt, and Syria have struggled for independence from dictatorships or oppressive governments.  They don’t have the same rights and freedoms as we do.  But they want it.  They want what Thomas Jefferson called “unalienable rights” that are “endowed by their Creator”.  Among those rights, he said, are “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”  
										</p>
										<p>I agree with Jefferson’s assessment of those rights, but God never promised that we’d have those rights provided to us by our government.  However, God has promised us something that is more precious than those unalienable rights:  independence from the slavery of sin.  We in our generation here in America have not experienced oppression or slavery from the powers that be.  But every one of us of age has been mired in sin, unable to free ourselves, and in need of rescue.  At times, we are deceived by Satan.  Other times, we purposely rebel against God and his laws.  The result is the same.  We have transgressed God’s laws and must pay the penalty.  According to Rom. 3:23, “the wages of sin is death”.  Death is what we “earn” through our sin.  It’s what we should receive. 
										</p>
										<p>But God, in his immense love for his creation, has extended his loving arms, condescending from his glorious throne in the person of Jesus for the express purpose of accepting the punishment for our sins.  “But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed…And the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all” (Is. 53:5-6).  Peter, in commenting on the passage from Isaiah, said that Jesus “bore our sins in His own body on the tree” (1 Peter 2:24).  God’s profound plan to interpose Jesus’ blood is what has given us the opportunity to be free from the snares of sin that so easily entrap us.  Praise God for his wisdom, his foresight, and his love!
										</p>
										<p>Now that I’m a parent, I am much more able to relate to the love God has for us.  I can only imagine the anguish I would feel if my children were kidnapped by some evil man intent on harming them if the ransom was not paid.  What parent among us would not allow anything to get in our way of rescuing them from that malicious individual?  We would do everything in our power and then some!  That’s the love we have for our children and the desire for their safety.  It’s the same love that God has for us.  We are his children that have been kidnapped by Satan.  And without hesitation, he paid the ransom.  Jesus took our place, giving us our freedom, our independence.
										</p>
										<p>The difference in these two situations is that God knew this was going to happen ahead of time.  He instilled in us the sense of right and wrong, he revealed himself and his will to us in the Bible, he warned us of the dangers of sin and of Satan, the father of sin, and he encouraged us to choose his ways instead of our ways.  However, “All we like sheep have gone astray; We have turned, every one, to his own way” (Is. 53:6).  We are the ones that have placed ourselves in the circumstances of needing to be rescued.  Isn’t it wonderful that God had enough love to free us from our own sins even though we had previously rejected him?
										</p>
										<p>
											Yes, sin is pleasurable…for a short amount of time.  Yes, sin is appealing.  Otherwise, there would be no temptation.  But sin only promises short-term satisfaction.  And in many cases, it’s very short-term as the physical consequences of sin can come upon us very quickly.  What Satan fails to mention is that sin has disastrous long-term effects, both in this life and eternally. 
											 </p>
										<p>There is great need for us to not be myopic in our view of life.  Paul encourages us to set our minds “on things above, not on things of the earth” (Col. 3:2).  When we do this and obey God’s will, we declare our independence from sin.  And God has promised us that we will receive that independence.  “But God be thanked that though you were slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine to which you were delivered...And having been set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness. But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves of God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, everlasting life.  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Rom. 3:17; 22-23).
