											<h3 class="seremon-title">All Things For Good, But Who’s Good?</h3>
											<div class="seremon-meta">

											</div>
											<p>One of the most well-known passages in the New Testament is found in Romans 8:28.  “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.”</p>
											<p>The magical verse to use for comfort!  The spiritual pill that solves all problems!  Of course I’m NOT being serious, but it sure seems that this verse is used in this way many times. </p>											
											<p>	I have stood alongside grieving parents whose son lies in a casket and have overheard folks saying this verse to them.  Are you serious?  Are we to think that this moment is good or that good can come from a teenage son who died without knowing the Lord? </p>
											<p>This magical verse has even been used to offer comfort to a woman with little children whose husband has left her for someone else.</p>
											<p>It seems that folks use this verse for all situations as a “happily ever after” truth.  No matter how bad the circumstances, you’ll see good again because of Romans 8.  There are two major thoughts here that some seem to forget.</p>
											<p>
												First, this verse isn’t a one-size-fits-all passage.  Paul is directing this to “those who love God” and “have been called.”  That’s not everyone, although I wish it was.  This doesn’t fit the guy down the street whose house burned down, who never darkens a church building, has a foul mouth, and believes not in God but in aliens.  Giving this verse to such a person doesn’t help, nor is it according to the will of God.  This is addressed to those walking with the Lord.</p>
											<p>Secondly, the good of this passage is not necessarily my personal good, but God’s good.  God causes things to work together for good...later, according to His purpose.  It might be good that I suffer, if that brings others to Christ.  God’s good is the kingdom, righteousness, hope, truth, and Heaven.  That’s what God is after.  If it takes dark valleys to accomplish that, so be it.  But using this verse to assure that fortunes will be restored, love will be found, or jobs will be secured is not the right direction.  The good is not our good that Paul is referring to but God’s good.</p>
											<p>Acts 13:22 tells us that David served God’s purpose.  He was raised up to do God’s will.  David’s life included giants, wars, rebellion, turmoil, and periods of peace.  I imagine David wouldn’t call all those things good, nor did all those circumstances work out for David’s good.  But it did work out for God’s good and for his purpose.  God moves things, God moves people, to fulfill His purpose. THY will be done is absolute.  That’s what Paul is addressing in Romans 8</p>
											<p>Within my life, things happen.  God does things.  As I walk with the Lord, He will use me and you as His instruments to accomplish His will.  The dying Christ on the cross illustrates this.  Personally, for Jesus, dying wasn’t a good thing.  It came after intense suffering and pain.  But for the cause of Christ, for “the good,” it had to be done.  It was worth it.</p>
											<p>The prodigal going to the pig pen was a good thing to get him to wake up and come home.  The goal of God is that we walk with Him.  He will do things to fulfill that purpose.  It is marvelous to know that God moves things to help us complete His purpose.  He is active in our lives and is doing things that we do not understand.</p>
											<p>
												Later in this very Roman chapter Paul would say, “tribulation, distress, persecution, famine or nakedness or peril or sword” will not separate us for the love of God.  That list isn’t a “nice” list.  I wouldn’t want to choose any of those.  They all involve suffering, shame, and pain.  Will those all turn into “good” things?  Not as some use our passage, but they can lead to the fulfilling and accomplishing of God’s will.</p>
											<p>
												It is hard for us to realize that life is not about us.  We are not the center of the universe.  God’s way is greater than us, including our personal joy and happiness.  If all we seek is to be happy, we live like the world, jumping from relationship to relationship, chasing fads, pretty on the outside, and hollow on the inside.  God has a plan for each one of us. Smiles on our faces aren’t it.  Getting to live selfish lives where we do anything we want, isn’t it.  It’s righteousness, holiness, and following Him.  If God must break us to get us there, that is good.  If we have to be slapped into reality, that is good.  If we lose all, but save our souls, that’s good.</p>
											<p>This is a powerful verse, if used correctly.  It is dangerous if misused.  We must be able to pray, “Thy will be done…” and live accordingly.</p>

											<h3 class="seremon-title">No Fear In Death</h3>
											<div class="seremon-meta">
												<div class="pastor"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> Desmond Osei</div>
												<div class="date"><i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> 18 mar 2014</div>
											</div>
											<p>At the end of Hebrews 2, the Hebrew writer introduces the point that Jesus was a “merciful and faithful
												High Priest”, a point he will more fully develop later in the epistle. He notes that it was important for
												Jesus to experience the same things we experience so that he might be the perfect High Priest. </p>
											<p>One of the experiences that he shared with us was death. And as a result of his death, he was able to do
												something that nobody else can do - take away the power of death and the fear of death. “Inasmuch
												then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that
												through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, 15 and release those
												who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.” (Heb. 2:14-15)
												</p>
											<p>Many people don’t even like to talk about death. Death is scary on many fronts. It’s the fear of the
												unknown. We don’t know what death really feels like. We can’t see the other side, so we don’t really
												know what awaits us. Nobody has died and come back from the grave to tell us what it’s like. And
												death is so final. There is no return from death. Those who have died are not coming back to us. Death
												is the end...in many people’s minds.
												</p>
											<p>It’s also scary for those who believe in being judged by God for the way they lived their life on earth.
												Knowing we have to answer for the things done in this life can be very scary - especially if we haven’t
												lived according to how we are instructed to live in the Bible.</p>
											<p>We will not have another opportunity, once we die, to fix any wrongs we have committed. It will be too
												late to say “I’m sorry” to those we have offended. It will be too late to ask God for forgiveness for our
												rebellious ways. God will not give us a second chance. Actually, when we think about it, he’s already
												given us many second chances. Each day is another opportunity. But death is final. There will be no
												more last chances. That’s scary.</p>
											<p>But these verses give us a couple of insights into death that are actually comforting for the Christian. </p>
											<p>First, death is the power of Satan. Death was not in God’s plan - life was. Remember in the Garden of
												Eden there was the Tree of Life. God did not want man to die, but due to the sin that Satan introduced
												into the world, death was also introduced. Too often, people blame God for death, for allowing people
												to die, for taking people’s lives. But death is not God’s fault. It’s our own fault for sinning, and death is
												from Satan. </p>
											<p>God doesn’t want death for man. He wants life. Death is God’s enemy. Notice what Paul said to the
												Corinthians. “Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an
												end to all rule and all authority and power. For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet.
												The last enemy that will be destroyed is death.” (1 Cor. 15:24-26) He will put an end to all authority
												and power. That includes Satan’s authority and power and the death over which he has power. That’s
												great news! Death will be defeated! God will overcome!
												</p>
											<p>Because of this fact, we have no reason to fear death if we have been faithful to our God. While we
												don’t know exactly what death feels like, and while we don’t know exactly what we will experience and
												what we will see, we do know that ultimately Jesus is on the other side. We do know that death is not
												really final. We know it’s really just the beginning for Christians. We know that we will no longer be 
												in bondage to the mortal and imperfect body. And we know that we have nothing to fear because Jesus
												has secured the victory on our behalf. Satan and his power has already been defeated by the resurrection
												of Jesus. What comforting thoughts! </p>
											<p>This is why the funerals of Christians are actually joyous occasions instead of sad ones. They are going
												home. They get to go be with their Brother and their Father. They receive the comfort that we all
												desire. They have overcome the power and fear of death through Jesus Christ.
												</p>
											<p>So what does this mean for me and you? First, we don't need to let the fact of death cripple us in fear.
												Rather, we ought to use it as motivation. We know what lies ahead. Later in Hebrews, the writer says,
												“it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment…” (Heb. 9:27). We need to be living
												our life with the understanding that death is final and that we will face the judgment of God afterwards.
												This life on earth is not all there is. We need to live our life with eternity in view rather than our typical
												myopic view seeing only the here and now. </p>
											<p>And this also means we can rejoice in the victory over Satan and his power of death. And we don’t need
												to be fearful of death. Rather, we ought to look forward to it! Paul certainly did. “For I am hardpressed between the two, having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.” (Phil. 1:23)
												And Peter said we ought to look forward to the coming Day of the Lord (2 Peter 3:12). We can only
												look for and hasten the coming of the Lord if we are faithful to him. What a day that will be! A day of
												victory! And the beginning of an eternity with our Father.</p>

											<h3 class="seremon-title">When Dreams Turn To Doubt</h3>
											<div class="seremon-meta">

											</div>
											<p>Nearly 20 times in the Scriptures, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are mentioned together. They are the faces of the Patriarchal Age and of the covenant God made with the Hebrews. But have you ever noticed how much space is devoted in the book of Genesis to telling the story of the fourth patriarch, Joseph? There is no effort to merely hit the highlights or skim the headlines of his life. In fact, the only other person who is given more chapters in the first book of the Bible is Abraham, the father of the faithful.</p>
											<p>I think there’s a reason for that. Many of us have felt what Joseph felt; we’ve been where Joseph was. That is, we’ve experienced the bitter disappointments of life. We’ve had things happen to us where even our own family members were against us. We’ve been accused of things that were not true and suffered just because we were trying to do the right thing.</p>
											<p>But how many of us have endured these things and responded the way Joseph did? Who has taken hit after hit and kept an unfailing faith in God? Perhaps that’s why so much space is given to telling his story.
											</p>
											<p> Joseph was called the “dreamer” by his brothers (Gen. 37:19). And he still serves as an example to the spiritual descendants of Abraham when our own dreams appear to be in doubt.</p>
											<p><b></b>You don’t have to be a slave to your circumstances.</b> Joseph’s brothers were so filled with hatred and jealously toward him that they sold him for the equivalency of $15, the price of a slave. Surely Joseph never dreamed his life would take a turn in that direction. But notice what path he pursued after his hopes seemingly came crashing down. “The Lord was with Joseph, and he was a successful man” (Gen. 39:2).</p>
											<p>Some people are looking for the perfect life. They want the perfect family who lives in the perfect house and drives the perfect car in the perfect world. But that’s not the way it works out. That’s not even the way it worked out for the man who holds the second-most amount of space in the book of Genesis. Yet, one of the common reactions when life deals us this way is to throw up our hands and concede defeat. You don’t have to do that. You don’t have to be a slave to bitterness, discouragement, and selfishness. When the Lord is with you, freedom is always in your future.</p>
											<p>When you’ve been wronged, you still have to act right. Potiphar’s wife, the original “Desperate Housewife,” was after Joseph. She “cast longing eyes”(Gen. 39:7) at him and pursued him “day by day” (Gen. 39:10) to lie with her. What was the response of a handsome 17 year-old-boy who was a captive in a foreign land? “How then could I do this great wickedness, and sin against God” (Gen. 39:9). In all that had happened to him, Joseph understood that committing fornication was not going to bring back what he had lost. Such a sin would only serve to make matters worse.</p>
											<p>We have a tendency at times to add trouble to trouble. The husband has a bad day at the office, so he comes home and yells at his wife and kids. A teenager thinks his parents are treating him unfairly so he goes out drinking with his friends. A wife has a husband who won’t communicate with her so she confides in another man and commits adultery. What problems do such actions solve? What relationships are repaired? Sin never makes a wrong right. Let our behavior, no matter the circumstances that surround us, be pleasing to our Master in heaven.</p>
											<p>
												Your plans may not always meet with God’s purpose. Years later, Joseph made himself known to his brothers having risen to second-in-command of all Egypt. But he did not repay evil for evil or punish them for what they had done. By then, he could see the bigger picture. “For God sent me before you to preserve life...and to save your lives by a great deliverance. So now it was not you who sent me here, but God”(Gen. 45:5-8). Surely Joseph had earlier prayed for deliverance from his brothers and for release from prison. But those prayers were answered not according to his timetable but in His time.</p>
											<p>We must maintain a similar faith in what God is working in our own lives. Remember, he causes “And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose”(Rom. 8:28). Joseph knew that the same God who brought Him down to Egypt in an Ishmaelite caravan would one day bring his family out of Egypt to inherit the land sworn to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Heb. 11:22). May we have such a confidence in the plans and purposes of God. How will you respond the next time you encounter various trials? Joseph’s example shows us that with God, our dreams really can come true.</p>

											<h3 class="seremon-title">Giving God Our Best</h3>
											<div class="seremon-meta">

											</div>
											<p>
												Malachi is the last book of the Old Testament, but it was also the last of God’s revealed word for almost 400 years until John the Baptist burst upon the scene.  In Malachi’s day, the people of Israel had returned from Babylonian captivity, had rebuilt Jerusalem and its walls, had restored the Temple and its worship, and were no longer worshiping idols.  A tremendous restoration had taken place.  But it wasn’t complete.  Their hearts had not been fully restored.  God sent one last prophet to the people to encourage them, remind them, and warn them of what they needed to correct.</p>
											<p>In the first chapter, God brings a complaint to the people.  “‘A son honors his father, and a servant his master.  If then I am the Father, where is My honor?  And if I am a Master, where is My reverence?  says the LORD of hosts to you priests who despise My name.  Yet you say, “In what way have we despised Your name?”  You offer defiled food on My altar, but say, “In what way have we defiled You?”  By saying, “The table of the LORD is contemptible.”  And when you offer the blind as a sacrifice, is it not evil?  And when you offer the lame and sick, is it not evil?’” (Mal. 1:6-8)  And later on, God accuses them of robbing him by not bringing the tithes and offerings they were supposed to (Mal. 3:8).
											</p>
											<p>Even though they were worshipping God, he wasn’t pleased.  That’s because they weren’t giving their best.  Rather, they were giving the worst.  But they didn’t recognize it.  They didn’t see anything wrong with what they were doing.  Several times in Malachi, God accuses them of something and they deny it.  I believe we can learn two lessons from this.
											</p>
											<p>First, too often we don’t see ourselves as God sees us.  We think we’re doing just fine.  We think we’re following God’s commands.  We think there’s nothing wrong with our heart.  All the while, God says we’ve got a long way to go.  We see this illustrated in Revelation with the church in Laodicea.  Jesus said to them, “‘Because you say, “I am rich, have become wealthy, and have need of nothing” – and do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked...’”  They thought they were doing great, but Jesus thought otherwise.  And they weren’t even close in their assessment of themselves!
											</p>
											<p>How does that happen?  It could be due to a wrong attitude towards sin.  Maybe we’ve lived among sin so much, seen so much of it in the world, that it doesn’t bother us anymore.  When we sin, we’re not ashamed.  After all, nobody’s perfect.  Everybody makes mistakes.  That type of thinking shows that we don’t think of sin in the same way God thinks of it.  Sin is awful.  Sin is repulsive to God.  Sin is an affront to the supremely holy Supreme Being.  If sin isn’t repulsive to us, we’re not going to be working diligently to rid it from our lives like we should.  That in turn will lead to us viewing ourselves in a much more favorable light than God sees us.  We need to be humbled.  We need to be poor in spirit and mourn because of our sin.  We need to hunger and thirst for righteousness.
											</p>
											<p>Secondly, God deserves our best.  God has never given us his leftovers, so why should we give him our leftovers?  He sent the best of heaven.  He has given us the best of everything.  It’s amazing to think about how seemingly insignificant we are in the grand scale of the universe.  Each of us is only one individual on an earth filled with 7 billion people.  Earth is not the biggest planet in the solar system.  Our Sun is not the biggest star in the Milky Way Galaxy.  The Milky Way is not the biggest galaxy in a universe filled with 200+ billion galaxies.  And yet God is very much mindful of each one of us.  If God thinks so highly of us and has given the best for us, shouldn’t we think highly of him?  After all, there is no one bigger or greater than the God who made this vast universe.  Shouldn’t we give our best to our great God? 
											</p>
											<p>When we think we don’t need to be or have to be at Bible class or worship, we’re not giving God the best.  When we attend church services because we have to instead of because we want to, we’re not giving our best.  When we sing songs out of habit without paying attention to or meaning the words that we’re singing, we’re not giving our best.  When we pray the same old prayer without much thought, we’re not giving God the best.  When we think about everything else except the sacrifice of Jesus while we partake of the Lord’s Supper, we’re not giving God our best.  When we give just a small amount (if anything) when the plate is passed because we’ve spent our money on our own pleasures and pursuits in life, we’re not giving God our best.  When we listen to the boring preacher drone on and wish he would hurry and get done rather than intently look with him into God’s word to find an application for our lives, we’re not giving God our best.
											</p>
											<p>The problem with the Israelites was they didn’t have hearts that were totally restored to God.  We can find ourselves in the same situation.  The world is tugging at our heart.  Our own desires and interests distract us from giving God the best.  We must realize that there is nothing as important as being passionate in our service to God.  Let’s look at this world and all the vain things therein through the same lens that God uses.  Let’s see sin for what it really is.  Let’s not let the Satan use the world to draw us away from our God.  Let’s give him our best.  Not just on Sundays and Wednesdays, but every day!

											<h3 class="seremon-title">The Value Of Time</h3>
											<div class="seremon-meta">
												<div class="pastor"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> Ebenezer Agyapong</div>
												<div class="date"><i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> 18 mar 2019</div>
											</div>
											<p>When we think of all that we possess, such as our homes, cars, clothes, various electronics, lawn equipment, etc., none of it is anywhere near as important as our time.  And none of it is anywhere near as valuable. 
											</p>
											<p>Some of us own bigger homes than others, newer cars than others, and more clothes than others.  But we’ve all been given exactly the same amount of time.  Each of us have 24 hours in a day.  That translates into 1440 minutes.  How are we using those minutes?
											</p>
											<p>Think about it in these terms.  If we were given $1440 at the beginning of each day to spend in any way we wanted, what would we do?  What if we were told that we couldn’t save it - that it had to be used up or we would lose whatever we didn’t use?  If we knew that whatever we didn’t invest in good purpose would be lost forever with no going back, we would make sure to find a way to spend that money.  We’d invest it so as to get from it the utmost in health, happiness and success!  We’d find others that we could help with the money rather than letting it go to waste.
											</p>
											<p>Unfortunately, we don’t do the same thing with the 1440 minutes we’ve been given each day, which is more valuable than $1440/day.  Too often, we let minutes and even hours just waste away and not invest them in anything with purpose.  Oh, we spend the time, but just not in the wisest and most profitable of ways.
											</p>
											<p>Think about some of the ways we spend our time, and try to prioritize these to see which are more important than others.  Obviously, we need sleep.  Go ahead and mark off 480 minutes if you’re lucky enough to get 8 hours of sleep.  We also need to eat.  If we allow 30 minutes for each meal, that’s another 90 minutes.  Assuming you work outside the home, you’re probably working about 8 hours a day.  That’s another 480 minutes.  Throw in a 30 minute commute to and from work for a total of 60 minutes.  We’re down to 330 minutes.  Not much left.  How we spend these remaining minutes will have a great impact on how good of a steward we are of the time God has given us.
											</p>
											<p>Many people will spend their remaining time with entertainment, such as TV.  Time spent watching TV can easily eat up 60-120 minutes each evening.  Most of us have computers and spend time surfing the internet or on Facebook or on reading/sending emails.  If you spend 60 minutes each evening in computer related activity, you’re down to 150 minutes.
											</p>
											<p>Some of you are in school, so time will be spent studying and doing homework.  Parents with kids in school will inevitably spend time helping them with their schoolwork.  If your children are involved in extracurricular activities such as scouts, band, or sports, those take time too.  Maybe you get together with some friends on a Friday or Saturday night.  As you can see, our few remaining minutes at the end of the day are quickly erased by the various activities we find ourselves involved in, and it’s time for bed again.
											</p>
											<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with any of those ways that we are spending the 1440 minutes we’ve been given, but not all of them are as profitable as others.  Also, every one of those time-spending activities can be abused. 
											</p>
											<p>We can be lazy and sleep too much, leaving little time for more important endeavors.  “A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to rest; So shall your poverty come like a prowler, And your need like an armed man.” (Prov. 24:33-34)
											</p>
											<p>We can spend too much time at work and shirk our first priority - the family.  If the reason we give is money related, we’re not trusting in the Lord.  “Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.”  (Matt. 6:31-33)
											</p>
											<p>Rest and relaxation and entertainment are good and necessary from time to time, but are we filling our minds with worldliness, sin, and filth of every kind?  Even if what we’re viewing is “clean”, we should still ask the question, “Is my time better spent doing something else?”
											</p>
											<p>Have we made the time to read our Bibles for the day?  Have we done more than read - have we studied and meditated on his word?  “I rise before the dawning of the morning, And cry for help; I hope in Your word.  My eyes are awake through the night watches, That I may meditate on Your word.” (Ps. 119:147-148)  Have we prepared for the upcoming Sunday or Wednesday Bible class?  Have we spent time sharing the good news of salvation through Jesus with a friend?  Have we talked to God?  More than just the quick prayer before our meals?
											</p>
											<p>Each of us needs to examine how we spend our 1440 minutes each day. I believe we all can probably do a better job of prioritizing our time. Too much of it is spent on things that don’t really matter. And too much of it is spent on things that actually hinder our faith and growth as a Christian. Let’s make sure we’re not majoring in the minors but rather putting the first things first. “See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil.”  (Eph. 5:16)

											<h3 class="seremon-title">How To Weaken Your Influence</h3>

											<p>Your influence is important and valuable, especially so as a Christian.  Scripture teaches us that one’s influence is more valuable than a precious ointment or even great wealth.  “A good name is better than precious ointment…”  (Eccl. 7:1)  “A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches…” (Prov. 22:1)
											</p>
											<p>Christ taught his disciples that their influence upon those around them, upon the world was of tremendous importance.  “Ye are the salt of the earth…” (Matt. 5:13-16)  Your influence is as fundamental and valuable as salt and light.  Luke 14:34-35 warns us of  what happens when salt loses its flavor, of when we stop being concerned about what others think of our actions.
											</p>
											<p>As we grow in maturity as Christians, we realize that it is not always about what we think is acceptable in our own mind and what we want, but that we become far more aware of what our actions will do in effecting others, both in the church and outside the church, and whether our actions will be a positive draw to bring those to Christ or one that pushes away those searching the truth. 
											</p>
											<p>There are many ways to be a negative influence on those around you.  Such as by being inconsiderate of others.  All things are lawful but not always expedient (1 Cor. 10:23).  It may well be necessary to change one’s actions in order to allow others to appease their own consciences even when your conscience is at ease.
											</p>
											<p>I will give an example.  The eating of meat, while lawful, would not be expedient if it caused a brother to stumble.  Here is another example.  There are certain dress codes that in our culture require us to “dress up” when in areas of responsibility or where we wish to show respect, such as in the work place, interviews, weddings, and so also in serving the congregation, showing respect to our Lord and brethren. When we “dress down” while in the capacity of serving, while lawful it is not necessarily expedient.  If we turn off visitors who might otherwise consider membership with us or offend Christians who in their conscience feel that a lack of respect is being shown to our Father, we are doing a disservice in not caring about how they might feel.  We can increase our influence and be a positive source by being considerate.
											</p>
											<p>Another way to be a negative influence is by being inconsistent.   For example, if your words are inconsistent with your deeds people will notice.  The world out there is always trying to catch those who profess to be Christians in inconsistency.  The world ridicules and mocks “church leaders” caught up in corruption and adultery, in fact, sin of any kind.  God warns us against the gross immorality and hypocrisy of inconsistency, of saying one thing and doing another.  “You then who teach others, do you not teach yourself?  While you preach against stealing, do you steal?” (Rom 2:21)
											</p>
											<p>Yet another way to be a negative influence is by being unreliable.  If you really want to weaken your influence and help Satan in his endeavors to draw away people from the kingdom and into the world, just be unreliable in your Christian and secular service.  Don’t be dependable.  When others ask of you a task or a job to do, don't always do what is expected of you.  Don’t be responsible.  Don't ever do your duty regularly, but rather intermittently, so no one knows whether in fact you will ever show up when you are supposed to.  Never ever volunteer.  There is the well-known saying about unreliable folk that goes like this, “Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.”  Again, let us be aware of how our influence can work for or against our Lord in spiritual things of this life and in the secular world as well.
											</p>
											<p>We can weaken our influence on others with an uncontrolled tongue.  For example, those who boast or gossip will destroy their ability to effect good.  “Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.” (Prov. 27:2)  And Prov. 26:20-22 reads, “For lack of wood the fire goes out, and where there is no whisperer, quarreling ceases.  As charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife.  The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels; they go down into the inner parts of the body.”
											</p>
											<p>Brothers and sisters, as we run the race before us, always with the goal of Heaven in our thoughts, and what we might do to heed the Great Commission to go out into all the world and teach and preach the gospel, we know that not all of us will be preachers, teachers, pastors, and other positions within the church.  But we do know this – we ALL have an influence on others.  Let’s be aware that it is not always what we desire or wish that is important, but reflect on what our influence is doing to promote others to see us and more importantly our Lord in a positive light and not a negative one.
											</p>
											<p>Our words, deeds, and actions will touch dozens of lives this week and every week.  They will leave memories, thoughts, examples, with those people.  Hopefully, they will spur them onto righteousness and not delinquency.
											</p>
											<p>I pray we will all take a moment to reflect on these thoughts and be encouraged, even as we perfect our faith in Christ through his good grace.
